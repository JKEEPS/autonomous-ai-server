# Archive Directory

This directory contains backup copies of files that were replaced during refactoring.

## Files

- `index.ts.original` - Original monolithic index.ts file before modular refactoring
  - Contains all the original functionality in a single file
  - Can be used to revert changes if needed
  - Backup created on: 2025-06-11

## Restoration Instructions

To revert to the original implementation:

1. Stop the current server
2. Copy `archive/index.ts.original` back to `src/index.ts`
3. Update package.json scripts to point to index.ts instead of server.ts
4. Rebuild and restart

```bash
# Revert command
copy archive\index.ts.original src\index.ts
```

## Notes

The original file was a comprehensive implementation with all tools in a single file. The refactored version splits this into modular components for better maintainability.
